# class_bot
A simple python script to automate entering my vitual classes.

I had been thinking about automating my pc to enter my zoom classes for some time, and i just had some time to code that idea. Very simple script but saves me from opening the notes app, copying the class info, typing it into zoom and recording the class if i need to.

## Tools used
* pyautogui
